# Hello-World
New to programming. Will accept all constructive criticism.

Hello. I wish to take this time to write a little something about why I got into Data Science and what I hope to accomplish with R/Python.
I realized with the recent election how much truth matters, but the act of finding truth has been obscured by the constant back and forth.
Truth should be nonpartisan. Truth shouldn't care about whom tells it. Sometimes truth will hurt. Accepting that is the mark of maturity
and a mature society. I hope to work to get there someday.

Thank you.
