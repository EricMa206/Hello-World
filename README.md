# Hello-World
New to programming. Will accept all constructive criticism.

Hello. I wish to take this time to write a little something about why I got into Data Science and what I hope to accomplish with R/Python.
I realized with the recent election how much truth matters, but the act of finding truth has been obscured by the constant back and forth.

Data Journalism is one of the ways I have realized this. Taking the time to separate out fact and fiction, trend from story. Politics has gotten me into Data Science but there is much more to the world than that.

Hello world.
