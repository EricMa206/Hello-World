# Hello-World
New to programming. Will accept all constructive criticism.

Hello. I wish to take this time to write a little something about why I got into Data Science and what I hope to accomplish with R/Python. I am interested in astronomy and center left politics. I'm really fascinated by the LIGO the Large Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and would love to dig in to what the data and the plans going forward are. I'm looking forward to working with all Flatironers going forward.


Hello world.
